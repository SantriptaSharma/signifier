# CS-2364 (Computer Graphics & Computational Imaging) Final Project
A simple SDF scene editor, built on top of raylib.

### Proposal
**Goal**: Build a user-facing application for modelling SDF scenes. For (sophisticated) examples, see [Mudbun](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/mudbun-volumetric-vfx-modeling-177891), [Clavicula](https://clavicula.link/), [SDF Modeler](https://sascha-rode.itch.io/sdf-modeler), [Clayxels](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/clayxels-165312).

**Method**: Use Raylib + Cpp. Implement the following (features marked with ?s are stretch features):
- Raymarcher for viewport rendering
- SDF primitives
- SDF operations
- Tool UI
- Scene loading & saving
- Mesh conversion (?)
- Keyframe Animation (??)
- Node-based interface for defining custom SDFs (???)
- Lua/other scripting interface for custom SDFs & animations (????)
