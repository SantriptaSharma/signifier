# CS-2364 (Computer Graphics & Computational Imaging) Final Project
A simple SDF scene renderer/viewer, built on top of raylib.

### Proposal
**Goal**: Build a user-facing application for viewing SDF scenes + provide a programmatic interface for designing them. For (sophisticated) examples, see [Mudbun](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/mudbun-volumetric-vfx-modeling-177891), [Clavicula](https://clavicula.link/), [SDF Modeler](https://sascha-rode.itch.io/sdf-modeler), [Clayxels](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/clayxels-165312).

**Method**: Use Raylib + Cpp. Implement the following:
- ~~Raymarcher for viewport rendering~~
- ~~SDF primitives~~
- ~~SDF operations~~
- Domain warps
- Layers, Effectors between layers, particularly for deformations
- Basic Tool UI (?)
